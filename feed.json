One of the main things is to handle the dough as little as possible.\r\n\r\n1. In a large bowl, mix flour, salt and yeast until well mixed. Pour in water and use a wooden spoon to stir until a shaggy dough forms. The mixture will be wet and very sticky to the touch.\r\n2. Cover bowl tightly with cling-film and put in a warm place 8 to 18 hours until dough rises, bubbles and flattens on top.\r\n3. Tip/pour the dough out onto a well floured work surface, using your well floured fingers to scrape the dough out of the bowl.\r\n4. Oil the bowl.\r\n5. Fold the dough in half.\r\n6. Then fold over a third of the dough in the other direction.\r\n7. Then fold the other third over.\r\n8. And turn the dough over.\r\n9. I oil the bowl and put it back in there but you can cover the dough with a piece of oiled cling-film and leave it at room temperature to rise until it has doubled in size (about 2 hours).\r\n10. Place a large dutch oven/casserole dish (with lid) in oven and heat oven to 220&#176;C for about 30 minutes.\r\n11. Remove dish from oven. Warning it is very very hot! Uncover dough and carefully transfer to dish, with or without parchment paper beneath (if bottom of dish is not coated with enamel, keep parchment paper beneath dough or oil the dish like I do). Cover and return to the oven.\r\n12. Bake the bread for 45 minutes covered, then another 5 to 10 minutes uncovered until dough is baked through and golden brown on top. Don't leave it too long uncovered because it will burn (and if it does just say it is \"well fired\"!). Cool before slicing.\n",

				"content_text": "The [AeroPress](http://aerobie.com/products/aeropress.htm) is my favourite coffee brew method right now. It just makes such a good, smooth cup. It somehow seems to make most beans taste better than the other methods at my disposal.\n\n## Recipes\n\nThere are [so](http://aerobie.com/images/AeroPress%20Instructions%20for%20Web%20L.pdf) [many](http://worldaeropresschampionship.wordpress.com/recipes/) [ways](http://www.hasbean.co.uk/pages/Aeropress-Brew-Guide.html) to make a cup with the AeroPress.\n\nI am not a fan of the [original](http://aerobie.com/images/AeroPress%20Instructions%20for%20Web%20L.pdf) way, I generally favour the inverted methods. You get a part brewed, part pressed, filtered coffee. The [Has Bean](http://www.hasbean.co.uk/pages/Aeropress-Brew-Guide.html) method is a good example.\n\nHowever I find my current method to be great. It's probably a bit of a mix of various methods I have been told or read (or it's exactly one I have read and just think I have made this, I just can't remember).\n\n## The Method\n\n1. Boil the water.\n2. Measure 15g - 16g of coffee (this varies depending on the coffee. Grind the beans, finer than for filter but a coarser than espresso.\n3. Put the plunger in the AeroPress so the bung is just fully in, so to around the 4 mark.\n4. Once the water has been off boil for a minute or two fill the AeroPress without coffee. This heats the AeroPress and lets your wash the filter paper at the same time.\n5. After a minute or so put 2 filters in the cap and attach to the AeroPress and plunge over the sink.\n6. Reset the AeroPress and put the coffee in.\n7. I have no idea what temperature the water is but it usually has been off boil for around 5 minutes by this point.\n8. Fill the AeroPress with water so the bubbles are just at the lip.\n9. Stir a little to make sure the grounds are all wet and start the stop watch, stirring for about 10 seconds.\n10. Leave for a minute.\n11. Stir for 10 seconds.\n12. Leave for another minute.\n13. Give it another quick stir.\n14. Put the cap on, hold a strong cup over the top and invert the whole thing so the AeroPress is now standing on the top of the cup.\n15. Plunge, but stop before the air comes out.\n16. Rinse AeroPress off.\n17. Add some more water from the kettle to fill the rest of the mug.\n18. Allow to cool a little, drink, enjoy.\n",

I think I have always liked taking photos.</p>\n<h2 id=\"original-film\">Original Film</h2>\n<p>When I was little my parents mostly used one of two cameras: an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_Trip_35\">Olympus Trip 35</a> and a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_T50\">Canon T50</a>. Both of which they still have but aren&rsquo;t used any more. I don&rsquo;t think anyone has tried the T50 for a long time but my brother apparently used the Trip a while back but the low light warning doesn&rsquo;t work any more (someone dropped it!).</p>\n<p>I remember the Trip being used a lot by Dad when we were on holidays, probably because it was smaller and he was probably having to deal with us. I can&rsquo;t remember how much my Mum took photos, I only really seem to remember Dad with the cameras. At somepoint I was allowed to use the Trip, but I don&rsquo;t remeber using it a lot. The T50 had my attention.</p>\n<p>I always thought the T50 was the best. It wound the film on itself, you could change the lens and you could manually focus it. I even got to take photos with it! I don&rsquo;t remember if they were good, probably not, but I learnt to change the lens between the two we had; a prime and a zoom, the zoom was the best. I also learnt to focus them, which really helped. The one very clear memory I have is playing with the camera with no film &ldquo;taking&rdquo; photos of this one toy car I had. You pulled the car back and let go. It went slowly but then after a little way it&rsquo;s bright yellow outer shell burst off to reveal a sports car and it went racing away; I loved that car. I think I was trying to get action shots.</p>\n<p>After this I think more school happened and I didn&rsquo;t really have a real camera. I got one of those <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Photo_System\">Advanced Photo System</a> point and shoot cameras.

One of the earlier, small cheap ones. It had a tiny terrible screen and it was likely very low resolution but I really enjoyed that. I remember getting a huge 256mb compact flash card for a cheap £30 or so (not sure how close that price is to reality). It also did stills and could record just sound. I remember using it a lot but can&rsquo;t remember what for and I can&rsquo;t find anything that was shot on it. I do remember making a video of the house one Christmas for Mum to remember where things were the next year.</p>\n<p>I used my phone camera for a year or so before I got a dedicated digital camera; a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N70\">Nokia N70</a>. I think it did a pretty good job overall:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/604/2025/1ff14429d8.jpg\" alt=\"Soulwax - Live\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/604/2025/f327a3f1af.jpg\" alt=\"Very very early morning in durham\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"its-getting-serious-now\">It&rsquo;s Getting Serious Now</h2>\n<p>The next camera I can remember getting was a while later (2008): a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Canon_Digital_IXUS_950IS.JPG\">Canon IXUS 950 IS</a>. After much Internet research I settled on the Canon. It&rsquo;s a really great point and shoot and did everything I wanted at the time. It could also have the custom firmware <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHDK#Custom_firmware\">CHDK</a> which let you do a lot of cool things that the camera shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to do, such as long exposures and movement triggering (for lightning! (that I didn&rsquo;t really get working)). I really liked the results I got out of that camera:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/604/2025/e757e7fd00.jpg\" alt=\"Sky from my window\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/604/2025/c1b1848820.jpg\" alt=\"Optimus Prime\"></p>\n<p>I loved I could get some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh\">bokeh</a> in the shots.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dslr\">DSLR</h2>\n<p>In 2009 I decided I wanted to step things up an get a DSLR.

This was at the time such a great choice. It was soon to be replaced by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D3000\">D3000</a> so it was actually fairly cheap.

I do remember making a video of the house one Christmas for Mum to remember where things were the next year.\r\n\r\nI used my phone camera for a year or so before I got a dedicated digital camera; a [Nokia N70](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N70). I think it did a pretty good job overall:\r\n\r\n![Soulwax - Live](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/604/2025/1ff14429d8.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Very very early morning in durham](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/604/2025/f327a3f1af.jpg)\r\n\r\n## It's Getting Serious Now ##\r\nThe next camera I can remember getting was a while later (2008): a [Canon IXUS 950 IS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Canon_Digital_IXUS_950IS.JPG). After much Internet research I settled on the Canon. It's a really great point and shoot and did everything I wanted at the time. It could also have the custom firmware [CHDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHDK#Custom_firmware) which let you do a lot of cool things that the camera shouldn't have been able to do, such as long exposures and movement triggering (for lightning! (that I didn't really get working)). I really liked the results I got out of that camera:\r\n\r\n![Sky from my window](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/604/2025/e757e7fd00.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Optimus Prime](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/604/2025/c1b1848820.jpg)\r\n\r\nI loved I could get some [bokeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh) in the shots.\r\n\r\n## DSLR ##\r\n\r\nIn 2009 I decided I wanted to step things up an get a DSLR. After much research again, I went with the suggestion from [Ken Rockwell](http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/recommended-cameras.htm) of the [Nikon D40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D40), it was good advice. This was at the time such a great choice. It was soon to be replaced by the [D3000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D3000) so it was actually fairly cheap. It's fast and works really well. I was very happy with the results with the [included lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_18-55mm_f/3.5-5.6G_AF-S_Zoom-Nikkor):\r\n\r\n![In the Colosseum](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/604/2025/4786fe7da8.jpg)\r\n\r\nBut I also wanted to get the [35mm prime lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_AF-S_DX_Nikkor_35mm_f/1.8G). I love the photos I get with this lens; it's the only one I end up using. I find it fantastic in most situations:\r\n\r\n![Roof](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/604/2025/900dc3bc76.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Maltese Bus](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/604/2025/3f6d474add.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Camera](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/604/2025/4a223c9bf4.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Out the door](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/604/2025/6d409358fc.jpg)\r\n\r\nDid I mention how much I love my photos from the D40.\r\n\r\nI would of course like a super fancy newer camera but it won't make my photos overall any better, probably just bigger (and videos), I'm so happy with my results right now.\r\n\r\n## iPhone ##\r\nI also like taking photos with my iPhone, the camera is good. The ridiculous amount of good editing software available for it is so great and so much fun.\r\n\r\n![Fairground Rides (Polaroid Style)](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/604/2025/13dda89831.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Clock Mechanism](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/604/2025/cae80bb647.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Film ##\r\nI love the look of shots taken on a film camera, just something about them. There is this shot of my group of friends at university that is grainy and kind of looks like it could have been taken anytime in the past 20-30 years (at least I think so).\r\n\r\nOne of my friends went around Europe in 2009 and took some great [photos on film](http://www.flickr.com/photos/44153487@N05/sets/72157622698220264/).\r\n\r\nLooking at all these photos made me want to try a film camera again so I got an Olypmus Trip from eBay. My first roll didn't go so well as I had apparently forgotton how to load a film. The second roll has been in the camera for about a year now, only a few shots left so I get to develop it soon!\r\n\r\n## Conclusion ##\r\nTake more photos.\n",

If you haven't played the first one for some reason things probably won't make that much sense.</p>\n<p>Portal had good writing and this second instalment did not disappoint on that front. The dialog was just great; witty, dark and fun. Having <a title=\"Stephen Merchant\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stephenmerchant.com/\">Stephen Merchant</a> voice your robot friend added so much more fun to the humour, some nice classic Merchant phrases.</p>\n<p>I was a little worried it was going to end too soon, especially as the first one was pretty short, but just when I thought it was over it took a very nice twist and kept going. This back half of the game really added to the backstory of Aperture Science and some nice easter eggs tied things more into the Half Life universe; which did serve as a good reminder that we really need Half Life 2 Episode 3 or just Half Life 3 to carry on the story.</p>\n<p>I was sad to see that upon completion I couldn't go back and attempt to speed run the test chambers or try some of them on hard like in the first game; I do love a good speed run (probably thanks to getting Goldeneye cheats). I can see how this might have been a little more difficult to incorporate this time around though.</p>\n<p>I have also done a couple of the co-op courses split screen which were loads of fun, more similar to the originals test chambers. Now if only any of my friends on Xbox Live would get the game so I could continue.</p>\n<p>Overall the single player is great, a good improvement on the first game, especially in the story department, but it was possibly less fun due to having more of a story. However I think the co-op test chambers make up for this, but I would like to see some more single player testing happen (<a title=\"Portal 2 DLC\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kotaku.com/#!5797142/free-portal-2-content-brings-new-test-chambers-and-challenge-modes-this-summer\">which appears to be coming in some free DLC this summer!</a>).</p>\n<p>Now I better get back to testing, for science.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>5 days too late to be a joke, very impressive indeed. It does kind of read like the plot to a movie though. Let's try a trailer:</p>&#13;\r\n<blockquote>&#13;\r\n<p>[The camera flys down into the ocean, diving deeper, getting darker.]</p>&#13;\r\n<p><strong>Voice Over</strong>: \"In world, where only 5% of the oceans have been explored, two men will increase that percentage.\"</p>&#13;\r\n<p>[Cut to Richard Branson]</p>&#13;\r\n<p><strong>Richard Branson</strong>: \"We need to see what's down there.\"</p>&#13;\r\n<p>[Cut to <span>Chris Welsh at a dock yard speaking to an old sailor with an pipe and eye patch]</span></p>&#13;\r\n<p><span><strong>Chris Welsh</strong>: \"We need a sub to get down to 37,000ft. I hear you're the man to build one.\"</span></p>&#13;\r\n<p><span><strong>Graham Hawkes (sub designer)</strong>: \"Aye, that I am, but it will cost you.\"</span></p>&#13;\r\n<p><span><strong>Chris Welsh</strong>: [Smiles] \"Don't worry, that won't be a problem.\"</span></p>&#13;\r\n<p><span>[Cut back to the dark ocean]</span></p>&#13;\r\n<p><span><strong>Voice Over</strong>: \"Virgin </span><span>Oceanic</span><span>\"</span></p>&#13;\r\n</blockquote>&#13;\r\n<p>Now back to reality, by the sounds of it they will only have one of the subs and so no hope of rescue. How about instead of that, Richard Branson uses some of his near infinite money to build maybe a second one, or maybe two.</p>&#13;\r\n<p><a title=\"Virgin Oceanic\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.virginoceanic.com/\">Virgin Oceanic</a></p>\r\n\r\n[Sir Richard Branson launches Virgin Oceanic: deep-sea exploring submarines](http://www.boingboing.net/2011/04/05/sir-richard-branson.html)\n",
