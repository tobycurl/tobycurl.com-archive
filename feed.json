One of the main things is to handle the dough as little as possible.\r\n\r\n1. In a large bowl, mix flour, salt and yeast until well mixed. Pour in water and use a wooden spoon to stir until a shaggy dough forms. The mixture will be wet and very sticky to the touch.\r\n2. Cover bowl tightly with cling-film and put in a warm place 8 to 18 hours until dough rises, bubbles and flattens on top.\r\n3. Tip/pour the dough out onto a well floured work surface, using your well floured fingers to scrape the dough out of the bowl.\r\n4. Oil the bowl.\r\n5. Fold the dough in half.\r\n6. Then fold over a third of the dough in the other direction.\r\n7. Then fold the other third over.\r\n8. And turn the dough over.\r\n9. I oil the bowl and put it back in there but you can cover the dough with a piece of oiled cling-film and leave it at room temperature to rise until it has doubled in size (about 2 hours).\r\n10. Place a large dutch oven/casserole dish (with lid) in oven and heat oven to 220&#176;C for about 30 minutes.\r\n11. Remove dish from oven. Warning it is very very hot! Uncover dough and carefully transfer to dish, with or without parchment paper beneath (if bottom of dish is not coated with enamel, keep parchment paper beneath dough or oil the dish like I do). Cover and return to the oven.\r\n12. Bake the bread for 45 minutes covered, then another 5 to 10 minutes uncovered until dough is baked through and golden brown on top. Don't leave it too long uncovered because it will burn (and if it does just say it is \"well fired\"!). Cool before slicing.\n",

You get a part brewed, part pressed, filtered coffee.

It's probably a bit of a mix of various methods I have been told or read (or it's exactly one I have read and just think I have made this, I just can't remember).\n\n## The Method\n\n1. Boil the water.\n2. Measure 15g - 16g of coffee (this varies depending on the coffee. Grind the beans, finer than for filter but a coarser than espresso.\n3. Put the plunger in the AeroPress so the bung is just fully in, so to around the 4 mark.\n4. Once the water has been off boil for a minute or two fill the AeroPress without coffee. This heats the AeroPress and lets your wash the filter paper at the same time.\n5. After a minute or so put 2 filters in the cap and attach to the AeroPress and plunge over the sink.\n6. Reset the AeroPress and put the coffee in.\n7. I have no idea what temperature the water is but it usually has been off boil for around 5 minutes by this point.\n8. Fill the AeroPress with water so the bubbles are just at the lip.\n9. Stir a little to make sure the grounds are all wet and start the stop watch, stirring for about 10 seconds.\n10. Leave for a minute.\n11. Stir for 10 seconds.\n12. Leave for another minute.\n13. Give it another quick stir.\n14. Put the cap on, hold a strong cup over the top and invert the whole thing so the AeroPress is now standing on the top of the cup.\n15. Plunge, but stop before the air comes out.\n16. Rinse AeroPress off.\n17. Add some more water from the kettle to fill the rest of the mug.\n18. Allow to cool a little, drink, enjoy.\n",

Both of which they still have but aren&rsquo;t used any more. I don&rsquo;t think anyone has tried the T50 for a long time but my brother apparently used the Trip a while back but the low light warning doesn&rsquo;t work any more (someone dropped it!).</p>\n<p>I remember the Trip being used a lot by Dad when we were on holidays, probably because it was smaller and he was probably having to deal with us. I can&rsquo;t remember how much my Mum took photos, I only really seem to remember Dad with the cameras. At somepoint I was allowed to use the Trip, but I don&rsquo;t remeber using it a lot. The T50 had my attention.</p>\n<p>I always thought the T50 was the best. It wound the film on itself, you could change the lens and you could manually focus it. I even got to take photos with it! I don&rsquo;t remember if they were good, probably not, but I learnt to change the lens between the two we had; a prime and a zoom, the zoom was the best. I also learnt to focus them, which really helped. The one very clear memory I have is playing with the camera with no film &ldquo;taking&rdquo; photos of this one toy car I had. You pulled the car back and let go. It went slowly but then after a little way it&rsquo;s bright yellow outer shell burst off to reveal a sports car and it went racing away; I loved that car.

I will let <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/07/19/google-plus-iphone\">John Gruber</a> explain better than I would:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>this Google+ app uses left-right swiping to change views in your “Stream”. I see three: Incoming, Circles, and Nearby. The idiomatic iOS design for this would be a tab controller at the bottom with three tabs, one for each view.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I do agree that it&rsquo;s not standard but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a bad choice, seems quite quick and a good alternative, especially for only 3 separate views; if there were more then I dont think it would be as good. What I don&rsquo;t like about this setup is you can only swipe, there is no tapping the header of the left/right views; it just tells you to swipe. It&rsquo;s one of those things that should be perfect alternative that users can find out. I think <a href=\"http://twitter.com/atebits\">Loren Brichter</a> actually explained this very well in this <a href=\"http://unraveled.com/archives/2009/11/tweetie-interview-loren-brichter\">interview</a> from 2009 about Tweetie 2:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now, I think you can split gestures into two categories. One is of the pull-down-to-refresh kind. These are gestures that are discoverable and explanatory. The other kind of gestures are like tapping-the-status-bar-to-scroll-to-the-top, or swipe-to-delete (or swipe-to-reply in Tweetie). These gestures you won’t discover on your own except by accident. These are not discoverable, and they are not explanatory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This second class of gestures can exist (in my opinion) because they are not the only way to accomplish a goal. In the case of tapping the status bar, users already know how to scroll to the top manually. It’s slower, but it’s possible. In the case of swipe to delete, users already know they can tap on a message and then tap the trash button. So knowing the gesture isn’t necessary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So when you’re inventing new gestures, it’s important to think about whether the gesture is required to use the app. If it’s the only way to accomplish a goal, you better be sure it’s discoverable and explanatory without needing to read a manual. If it’s the other kind of gesture, go nuts!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would class tapping the header left/right text as the second type; you would probably only discover it by accident, but it would be a perfectly acceptable way to navigate. What I don&rsquo;t like at the moment is the big popup that appears telling you to scroll instead; it&rsquo;s an iOS app, we probably would swipe automatically anyway (plus I have a recollection that it gave you a message at on the first launch that you should swipe anyway).</p>\n<p>I can see no reason to use the web app over this native one, it&rsquo;s a good start.</p>\n",

The idiomatic iOS design for this would be a tab controller at the bottom with three tabs, one for each view.\n\nI do agree that it's not standard but I don't think it's a bad choice, seems quite quick and a good alternative, especially for only 3 separate views; if there were more then I dont think it would be as good. What I don't like about this setup is you can only swipe, there is no tapping the header of the left/right views; it just tells you to swipe. It's one of those things that should be perfect alternative that users can find out. I think [Loren Brichter](http://twitter.com/atebits) actually explained this very well in this [interview](http://unraveled.com/archives/2009/11/tweetie-interview-loren-brichter) from 2009 about Tweetie 2:\n\n> Now, I think you can split gestures into two categories. One is of the pull-down-to-refresh kind. These are gestures that are discoverable and explanatory. The other kind of gestures are like tapping-the-status-bar-to-scroll-to-the-top, or swipe-to-delete (or swipe-to-reply in Tweetie). These gestures you won’t discover on your own except by accident. These are not discoverable, and they are not explanatory.\n\n> This second class of gestures can exist (in my opinion) because they are not the only way to accomplish a goal. In the case of tapping the status bar, users already know how to scroll to the top manually. It’s slower, but it’s possible. In the case of swipe to delete, users already know they can tap on a message and then tap the trash button. So knowing the gesture isn’t necessary.\n\n> So when you’re inventing new gestures, it’s important to think about whether the gesture is required to use the app. If it’s the only way to accomplish a goal, you better be sure it’s discoverable and explanatory without needing to read a manual. If it’s the other kind of gesture, go nuts!\n\nI would class tapping the header left/right text as the second type; you would probably only discover it by accident, but it would be a perfectly acceptable way to navigate. What I don't like at the moment is the big popup that appears telling you to scroll instead; it's an iOS app, we probably would swipe automatically anyway (plus I have a recollection that it gave you a message at on the first launch that you should swipe anyway).\n\nI can see no reason to use the web app over this native one, it's a good start.\n",

If you haven't played the first one for some reason things probably won't make that much sense.</p>\n<p>Portal had good writing and this second instalment did not disappoint on that front. The dialog was just great; witty, dark and fun. Having <a title=\"Stephen Merchant\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.stephenmerchant.com/\">Stephen Merchant</a> voice your robot friend added so much more fun to the humour, some nice classic Merchant phrases.</p>\n<p>I was a little worried it was going to end too soon, especially as the first one was pretty short, but just when I thought it was over it took a very nice twist and kept going. This back half of the game really added to the backstory of Aperture Science and some nice easter eggs tied things more into the Half Life universe; which did serve as a good reminder that we really need Half Life 2 Episode 3 or just Half Life 3 to carry on the story.</p>\n<p>I was sad to see that upon completion I couldn't go back and attempt to speed run the test chambers or try some of them on hard like in the first game; I do love a good speed run (probably thanks to getting Goldeneye cheats). I can see how this might have been a little more difficult to incorporate this time around though.</p>\n<p>I have also done a couple of the co-op courses split screen which were loads of fun, more similar to the originals test chambers. Now if only any of my friends on Xbox Live would get the game so I could continue.</p>\n<p>Overall the single player is great, a good improvement on the first game, especially in the story department, but it was possibly less fun due to having more of a story. However I think the co-op test chambers make up for this, but I would like to see some more single player testing happen (<a title=\"Portal 2 DLC\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://kotaku.com/#!5797142/free-portal-2-content-brings-new-test-chambers-and-challenge-modes-this-summer\">which appears to be coming in some free DLC this summer!</a>).</p>\n<p>Now I better get back to testing, for science.</p>\n",
