			 <p>My current no-knead bread recipe! It makes one large loaf. The recipe is from the following places and has a few changes to suit my needs. <a href="http://m.reallynicerecipes.com/recipe/breads/no-knead">The recipe here</a> and <a href="http://www.thedailyspud.com/2009/04/15/there-really-is-no-knead/">the baking part here</a>.
 </p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>500g strong white bread flour</li>
<li>7g - 10g dried instant yeast (or whatever is in a sachet)</li>
<li>12g salt (if you don’t put enough salt in it will taste of nothing and be terrible)</li>
<li>400ml cold water</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<p>I usually start this at about 19:00 - 20:00 the day before I want the bread so I can bake it time for lunch! One of the main things is to handle the dough as little as possible.</p>
<ol>
<li>In a large bowl, mix flour, salt and yeast until well mixed. Pour in water and use a wooden spoon to stir until a shaggy dough forms. The mixture will be wet and very sticky to the touch.</li>
<li>Cover bowl tightly with cling-film and put in a warm place 8 to 18 hours until dough rises, bubbles and flattens on top.</li>
<li>Tip/pour the dough out onto a well floured work surface, using your well floured fingers to scrape the dough out of the bowl.</li>
<li>Oil the bowl.</li>
<li>Fold the dough in half.</li>
<li>Then fold over a third of the dough in the other direction.</li>
<li>Then fold the other third over.</li>
<li>And turn the dough over.</li>
<li>I oil the bowl and put it back in there but you can cover the dough with a piece of oiled cling-film and leave it at room temperature to rise until it has doubled in size (about 2 hours).</li>
<li>Place a large dutch oven/casserole dish (with lid) in oven and heat oven to 220°C for about 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove dish from oven. Warning it is very very hot! Uncover dough and carefully transfer to dish, with or without parchment paper beneath (if bottom of dish is not coated with enamel, keep parchment paper beneath dough or oil the dish like I do). Cover and return to the oven.</li>
<li>Bake the bread for 45 minutes covered, then another 5 to 10 minutes uncovered until dough is baked through and golden brown on top. Don&rsquo;t leave it too long uncovered because it will burn (and if it does just say it is &ldquo;well fired&rdquo;!). Cool before slicing.</li>
</ol>

It was fantastic again although my memory of half of the game from the N64 version was nearly completely gone.</p>
<p>I clearly remember the first half of the game; the first two dungeons. The second half I have nearly no memory of. I remember a lot of the side quests, and definitely getting the very last mask before.</p>
<p>I find it strange not remembering half of a game but I suspect I only played it through once rather than, for example, the many times I played though <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time" title="The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Ocarina of Time</a> on the N64.</p>

			 <p>I have just finished <a href="http://zelda.com/link-between-worlds/">the latest zelda game:  A Link Between Worlds.</a> and what a fun game it is. It has all the regular fun of Zelda but with the added nostalgia of the older top down Zelda games (it&rsquo;s set in the same world as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past">A Link to the Past</a>).</p>
<p>One of a great things about this game is instead of having to play for hours before you get various weapons you can rent nearly all of them very early in to the game. So instead of passing cracked rocks that you know can be broken by a certain tool you can break them right there and then. This also allows you to tackle the dungeons in whatever order you happen to get to them.</p>
<p>I would definitely recommend this one.</p>

			 <p>On my Mac the &lsquo;Open With&rsquo; list in the context menu keeps filling up with duplicate entries for apps. Not really sure why it keeps happening but I keep forgetting how to clean it and then not being able to find the solution again.</p>
<p>So this is how to do it:</p>
<p>Enter this into terminal (this is on 10.8 the file path might be different on other version of OS X):</p>
<pre><code>/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user
</code></pre>
<p>I have also created an alias for this in my bash profile:</p>
<pre><code>alias cleanopenwith='/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user'

			 <p>The <a href="http://aerobie.com/products/aeropress.htm">AeroPress</a> is my favourite coffee brew method right now. It just makes such a good, smooth cup. It somehow seems to make most beans taste better than the other methods at my disposal.</p>
<h2 id="recipes">Recipes</h2>
<p>There are <a href="http://aerobie.com/images/AeroPress%20Instructions%20for%20Web%20L.pdf">so</a> <a href="http://worldaeropresschampionship.wordpress.com/recipes/">many</a> <a href="http://www.hasbean.co.uk/pages/Aeropress-Brew-Guide.html">ways</a> to make a cup with the AeroPress.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of the <a href="http://aerobie.com/images/AeroPress%20Instructions%20for%20Web%20L.pdf">original</a> way, I generally favour the inverted methods. You get a part brewed, part pressed, filtered coffee. The <a href="http://www.hasbean.co.uk/pages/Aeropress-Brew-Guide.html">Has Bean</a> method is a good example.</p>
<p>However I find my current method to be great. It&rsquo;s probably a bit of a mix of various methods I have been told or read (or it&rsquo;s exactly one I have read and just think I have made this, I just can&rsquo;t remember).</p>
<h2 id="the-method">The Method</h2>
<ol>
<li>Boil the water.</li>
<li>Measure 15g - 16g of coffee (this varies depending on the coffee. Grind the beans, finer than for filter but a coarser than espresso.</li>
<li>Put the plunger in the AeroPress so the bung is just fully in, so to around the 4 mark.</li>
<li>Once the water has been off boil for a minute or two fill the AeroPress without coffee. This heats the AeroPress and lets your wash the filter paper at the same time.</li>
<li>After a minute or so put 2 filters in the cap and attach to the AeroPress and plunge over the sink.</li>
<li>Reset the AeroPress and put the coffee in.</li>
<li>I have no idea what temperature the water is but it usually has been off boil for around 5 minutes by this point.</li>
<li>Fill the AeroPress with water so the bubbles are just at the lip.</li>
<li>Stir a little to make sure the grounds are all wet and start the stop watch, stirring for about 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Leave for a minute.</li>
<li>Stir for 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Leave for another minute.</li>
<li>Give it another quick stir.</li>
<li>Put the cap on, hold a strong cup over the top and invert the whole thing so the AeroPress is now standing on the top of the cup.</li>
<li>Plunge, but stop before the air comes out.</li>
<li>Rinse AeroPress off.</li>
<li>Add some more water from the kettle to fill the rest of the mug.</li>
<li>Allow to cool a little, drink, enjoy.</li>
</ol>

			 <p>I used to really dislike coffee (as my brother keeps reminding me when I try to push for better coffee at my parents). Now I really like coffee and for that I mostly blame my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/agduncan/">Andrew Duncan</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-early-years">The Early Years</h2>
<p>The earliest I can remember actually having a coffee I liked was probably 1997/1998 when we went to Canada on holiday. I&rsquo;m fairly sure I had a coffee Frappuccino type drink which was likely from Starbucks. I probably enjoyed this because it was cold, sweet and full of milk so took away the bitterness usually associated with coffee. I think from then I probably started to drink coffee on occasion at home; instant with lots of milk and sugar.</p>
<h3 id="proper-coffee">Proper Coffee</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m fairly sure my parents had ground coffee either on a Sunday with breakfast or for special occasions. My brother and I always enjoyed plunging the cafetiere (who doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s the best bit if you&rsquo;re not drinking it!). I&rsquo;m sure I had some on occasion but I have no good memory of it.</p>
<h2 id="the-university-years">The University Years</h2>
<p>Mostly instant, but more of it. I got a little <a href="http://www.firebox.com/product/2101/Desktop-Coffee-Maker">desktop coffee machine</a> (although older that that one, with only one tiny mug) as a present so needed some actual ground coffee. It worked pretty well for a tiny cup of coffee and sure helped for 9am lectures.</p>
<p>In my third year someone in our house got a drip coffee machine so that was good for a while.</p>
<h2 id="starting-work">Starting Work</h2>
<p>Once I got a job I was persuaded to get rid of the instant and go for the pre ground from the supermarket. I generally ended up with the <a href="http://www.lavazza-coffee.co.uk/Blends_Rossa.aspx">Qualità Rossa</a> blend from Lavazza and sure remember enjoying it. It all started to build up from there.</p>
<h2 id="fresh-roasted">Fresh Roasted</h2>
<p>I started ordering fresh roasted but ground coffee from <a href="http://www.hasbean.co.uk/">Has Bean</a>. Then I got this awesome <a href="http://www.coffeehit.co.uk/hario-skerton-coffee-mill/p441">hand grinder</a> and obviously started ordering whole beans. I got an <a href="http://www.baratza.com/baratza-grinder-information/encore-grinder/">electric grinder</a> (although it&rsquo;s the older version now, the Maestro Plus) last year and it&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>The number of brew methods I had at my disposal also increased. The obvious starting point of a cafetiere, then an <a href="http://aerobie.com/products/aeropress.htm">AeroPress</a> and then a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0056ZVVHA">SwissGold one cup filter</a>. All make a great cup of coffee.</p>
<p>I use the SwissGold by far the most. It makes a good cup with very little effort and interaction. This is extremely handy first thing in the morning as I am rushing to get out the door. The AeroPress is my favourite though. It makes such a good, smooth cup.</p>
<h2 id="good-beans">Good Beans</h2>
<p>I generally get my beans from <a href="http://www.hasbean.co.uk/">Has Bean</a>, the best beans with the best service.</p>
<p>I go for a different coffee every time just to try them. Through a process of elimination I have come to find I enjoy the earthier coffees a lot more than the fruity ones. It&rsquo;s a difficult thing to tell, as it&rsquo;s mainly a description from the roaster as I can&rsquo;t tell myself (most of the time) when a coffee would be described as fruity. Sometimes you can really taste a certain flavour though; there was this lovely one from Bolivia last year that had a great biscuit taste.</p>
<h2 id="additives">Additives</h2>
<p>When I have a good cup with good beans I just drink it black. If it&rsquo;s done right then it&rsquo;s not bitter and doesn&rsquo;t have any of the bad tastes. It can be naturally sweet and tastes great. Sometimes I get the need for a milky cup though and that&rsquo;s good too.</p>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, I like coffee a lot. I only generally have one cup a day. It tastes great.</p>

<p>The glasses look a little strange, like Geordi La Forge&rsquo;s visor&hellip;they might go over a little better if they looked more Warby Parkerish.</p>

<p>As futuristic as they look, a pair of classic glasses seem to me like a better idea. Especially if you already wear glasses, then you could just get a prescription pair.</p>
<p>Now all we need is for them to be as immersive as the glasses in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denn%C5%8D_Coil">Dennō Coil</a>.</p>

			 <p>I like taking photos. I think I have always liked taking photos.</p>
<h2 id="original-film">Original Film</h2>
<p>When I was little my parents mostly used one of two cameras: an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_Trip_35">Olympus Trip 35</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_T50">Canon T50</a>. Both of which they still have but aren&rsquo;t used any more. I don&rsquo;t think anyone has tried the T50 for a long time but my brother apparently used the Trip a while back but the low light warning doesn&rsquo;t work any more (someone dropped it!).</p>
<p>I remember the Trip being used a lot by Dad when we were on holidays, probably because it was smaller and he was probably having to deal with us. I can&rsquo;t remember how much my Mum took photos, I only really seem to remember Dad with the cameras. At somepoint I was allowed to use the Trip, but I don&rsquo;t remeber using it a lot. The T50 had my attention.</p>
<p>I always thought the T50 was the best. It wound the film on itself, you could change the lens and you could manually focus it. I even got to take photos with it! I don&rsquo;t remember if they were good, probably not, but I learnt to change the lens between the two we had; a prime and a zoom, the zoom was the best. I also learnt to focus them, which really helped. The one very clear memory I have is playing with the camera with no film &ldquo;taking&rdquo; photos of this one toy car I had. You pulled the car back and let go. It went slowly but then after a little way it&rsquo;s bright yellow outer shell burst off to reveal a sports car and it went racing away; I loved that car. I think I was trying to get action shots.</p>
<p>After this I think more school happened and I didn&rsquo;t really have a real camera. I got one of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Photo_System">Advanced Photo System</a> point and shoot cameras. It wasn&rsquo;t great, but this did let me see what happens when you open the back of the camera with a film in: the developer sticks an infuriating sticker on the picture telling you not to do that.</p>
<h2 id="on-to-digital">On to Digital</h2>
<p>At some point I got a digital video camera. One of the earlier, small cheap ones. It had a tiny terrible screen and it was likely very low resolution but I really enjoyed that. I remember getting a huge 256mb compact flash card for a cheap £30 or so (not sure how close that price is to reality). It also did stills and could record just sound. I remember using it a lot but can&rsquo;t remember what for and I can&rsquo;t find anything that was shot on it. I do remember making a video of the house one Christmas for Mum to remember where things were the next year.</p>
<p>I used my phone camera for a year or so before I got a dedicated digital camera; a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N70">Nokia N70</a>. I think it did a pretty good job overall:</p>
<p><img src="https://tobycurl.com/uploads/2025/1ff14429d8.jpg" alt="Soulwax - Live"></p>
<p><img src="https://tobycurl.com/uploads/2025/f327a3f1af.jpg" alt="Very very early morning in durham"></p>
<h2 id="its-getting-serious-now">It&rsquo;s Getting Serious Now</h2>
<p>The next camera I can remember getting was a while later (2008): a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Canon_Digital_IXUS_950IS.JPG">Canon IXUS 950 IS</a>. After much Internet research I settled on the Canon. It&rsquo;s a really great point and shoot and did everything I wanted at the time. It could also have the custom firmware <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHDK#Custom_firmware">CHDK</a> which let you do a lot of cool things that the camera shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to do, such as long exposures and movement triggering (for lightning! (that I didn&rsquo;t really get working)). I really liked the results I got out of that camera:</p>
<p><img src="https://tobycurl.com/uploads/2025/e757e7fd00.jpg" alt="Sky from my window"></p>
<p><img src="https://tobycurl.com/uploads/2025/c1b1848820.jpg" alt="Optimus Prime"></p>
<p>I loved I could get some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh">bokeh</a> in the shots.</p>
<h2 id="dslr">DSLR</h2>
<p>In 2009 I decided I wanted to step things up an get a DSLR. After much research again, I went with the suggestion from <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/recommended-cameras.htm">Ken Rockwell</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D40">Nikon D40</a>, it was good advice. This was at the time such a great choice. It was soon to be replaced by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D3000">D3000</a> so it was actually fairly cheap. It&rsquo;s fast and works really well. I was very happy with the results with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_18-55mm_f/3.5-5.6G_AF-S_Zoom-Nikkor">included lens</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://tobycurl.com/uploads/2025/4786fe7da8.jpg" alt="In the Colosseum"></p>
<p>But I also wanted to get the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_AF-S_DX_Nikkor_35mm_f/1.8G">35mm prime lens</a>. I love the photos I get with this lens; it&rsquo;s the only one I end up using. I find it fantastic in most situations:</p>
<p><img src="https://tobycurl.com/uploads/2025/900dc3bc76.jpg" alt="Roof"></p>
<p><img src="https://tobycurl.com/uploads/2025/3f6d474add.jpg" alt="Maltese Bus"></p>
<p><img src="https://tobycurl.com/uploads/2025/4a223c9bf4.jpg" alt="Camera"></p>
<p><img src="https://tobycurl.com/uploads/2025/6d409358fc.jpg" alt="Out the door"></p>
<p>Did I mention how much I love my photos from the D40.</p>
<p>I would of course like a super fancy newer camera but it won&rsquo;t make my photos overall any better, probably just bigger (and videos), I&rsquo;m so happy with my results right now.</p>
<h2 id="iphone">iPhone</h2>
<p>I also like taking photos with my iPhone, the camera is good. The ridiculous amount of good editing software available for it is so great and so much fun.</p>
<p><img src="https://tobycurl.com/uploads/2025/13dda89831.jpg" alt="Fairground Rides (Polaroid Style)"></p>
<p><img src="https://tobycurl.com/uploads/2025/cae80bb647.jpg" alt="Clock Mechanism"></p>
<h2 id="film">Film</h2>
<p>I love the look of shots taken on a film camera, just something about them. There is this shot of my group of friends at university that is grainy and kind of looks like it could have been taken anytime in the past 20-30 years (at least I think so).</p>
<p>One of my friends went around Europe in 2009 and took some great <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44153487@N05/sets/72157622698220264/">photos on film</a>.</p>
<p>Looking at all these photos made me want to try a film camera again so I got an Olypmus Trip from eBay. My first roll didn&rsquo;t go so well as I had apparently forgotton how to load a film. The second roll has been in the camera for about a year now, only a few shots left so I get to develop it soon!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Take more photos.</p>

The talk wasn&rsquo;t about iCloud but one of his answers to a question at the end (around 46 minutes) he talked about not being able to use iCloud unless your app was in the App Store. This has been recently brought up with regards to the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/security.html">Gatekeeper</a> funcitonality Mountatin Lion and so reminded me of a point I haven&rsquo;t seen<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="#fnr1-2012-02-26">1</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->: the cost of iCloud to Apple.</p>
<p>A lot of the arguments about Apple keeping iCloud App Store only seem to focus on security, keeping developers from storing massive amounts of arbitrary data in iCloud and other such things. These are all very valid reasons and on their own good enough reasons for Apple to do this. However what about the cost of running iCloud, because it must cost Apple something. Some of the cost is likely factored into the initial purchase of the devices and Apple must take some of the money from their 30% of app sales to fund iCloud. If Apple allowed any developers to use iCloud then those not in the App Store would be costing them money.</p>
<p>However it is also likely that the cost of iCloud is negligible compared to other things and that all of Apples vast profits easily cover all running costs of the service.</p>
<p>There must be a cost somewhere.</p>

			 <p>If you hadn&rsquo;t heard, it&rsquo;s pretty great. Here are a few points I wanted to talk about.</p>
<h2 id="icloud">iCloud</h2>
<p>iCloud seems to be holding up pretty well so far. I haven&rsquo;t heard of any major issues and I haven&rsquo;t had any, which does bode well. The only minor problem I had was when setting it up on my Mac. Everything seemed to enable except the &ldquo;Mail &amp; Notes&rdquo; option in the settings. I would check the box, it would say starting, but then upon leaving the screen and going back in the box was unchecked and mail not set up. Leaving this alone for an hour or so, then trying it again worked fine, so I can only assume that it was just a slight connection issue. However there was no message saying such, it just didn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<h2 id="notification-centre">Notification Centre</h2>
<p>Notification Centre seems to be liked by some but not by others. I do like it. The problem some people seem to be having looks like more to do with habit than anything else; not checking Notification Centre. I see it as something that people would actually get used to doing over time. A scenario for this problem is given by Ben Brooks in his article <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/10/notification-center/">The Annoyment Center</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So here’s a common scenario for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>While driving home from work I get notifications from OmniFocus, Twitter, Text Messages.</li>
<li>At some point during the drive I need to make a phone call, so I unlock the phone and make the call, using voice dial or Dialvetica.</li>
<li>I get home and use my phone to check Twitter and Email, but now all the notifications that were on the lock screen are gone because I unlocked my phone and made that call.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore: I never see those notifications. I thought this entire system was designed so that I don’t miss notifications any more?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would argue that the last bullet point should read &ldquo;I get home and use my phone to check <strong>Notification Centre</strong>, Twitter and Email&hellip;&quot;; so you still see relevant, up to date, notifications that you may have missed but are now gone from the lock screen.</p>
<h2 id="user-defined-keyboard-shortcuts">User-Defined Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
<p>I am just coming round to seeing the usefulness of <a href="http://www.smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a> on my Mac and these are a good way to get a bit of that functionality built into every text fields in iOS. These can be set in Settings &gt; General &gt; Keyboard.</p>
<h2 id="ipad-gestures">iPad Gestures</h2>
<p>I got round to having a long play on my iPad last night with iOS 5 installed and these new gestures are just awesome. With 4 or 5 fingers they let you swipe left and right to switch apps, swipe up to get the app switched and pinch to go to the home screen. Much less double clicking the home button is great.</p>

			 <p>Just seen (only a month late) WriteRoom has been updated on iOS and it looks like a good one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how long there has been an iPad version/iPad version was added but I don&rsquo;t remember using it before. It looks great and now has Dropbox support. I have been using Elements for my writing needs on iOS for a while, mostly for it&rsquo;s Dropbox support, but WriteRoom seems to be doing a great job whilst I am writing this.</p>
<p>This version 3.0 of WriteRoom has also added an extra, customisable row of keys to the iPads keyboard. I have just started to use Markdown for my posts and this will help a lot on the iPad; it just makes getting to the square brackets fast, it also adds a tab key. The only thing that&rsquo;s missing for Markdown is a Markdown preview which Elements does well.</p>

			 <p>Fun times were had by all this weekend at some Edinburgh Fringe shows!</p>
<p>Here a few brief comments on the shows we went to see in order of viewing:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/comedy/gentlemen-of-leisure-present-the-death-of-the-novel">The Gentlemen of Leisure Present: The Death of the Novel</a>:</p>
<p>Their show this year explores the novel and it&rsquo;s possible demise. It&rsquo;s a great show, really enjoyed it, go see it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/comedy/alun-cochrane-moments-of-alun">Alun Cochrane: Moments of Alun</a>:</p>
<p>It was a good show, he is very funny, but not one of my favourites.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/theatre/shakespeare-for-breakfast">Shakespeare for Breakfast</a>:</p>
<p>A fun way to start a day; a funny take on Macbeth, coffee and a croissant, what&rsquo;s not to like.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/comedy/humphrey-ker-is-dymock-watson-nazi-smasher">Humphrey Ker is Dymock Watson: Nazi Smasher!</a>:</p>
<p>This was an awesome show, go see this one. It&rsquo;s a great and hilarious World War II story (which is apparently &ldquo;true(ish)&rdquo; according to the fringe site).</p>
<p>Hopefully I will get to see a few more shows this year.</p>

			 <p>So the Google+ iOS app got released, I think it&rsquo;s pretty nice. They did a good job overall with the mobile site but it&rsquo;s just not quite as good as a native app.</p>
<p>The main &ldquo;home&rdquo; screen has 5 icons at the moment, big enough targets, gets you to the place you want. This is nearly identical to the Facebook app when navigating between functions; I am not a big fan of this; one place where I think a tab controller would be better suited; faster to use too.</p>
<p>The rest of the functions like photos and circles are pretty standard and work well. The Huddle feature is a good idea, data based group messaging, would save sending out lots of SMS messages, but it didn&rsquo;t work very quickly when I tried it and there seems to be no way to view these on the website. The Stream view has probably the most different from other apps. I will let <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/07/19/google-plus-iphone">John Gruber</a> explain better than I would:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this Google+ app uses left-right swiping to change views in your “Stream”. I see three: Incoming, Circles, and Nearby. The idiomatic iOS design for this would be a tab controller at the bottom with three tabs, one for each view.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do agree that it&rsquo;s not standard but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a bad choice, seems quite quick and a good alternative, especially for only 3 separate views; if there were more then I dont think it would be as good. What I don&rsquo;t like about this setup is you can only swipe, there is no tapping the header of the left/right views; it just tells you to swipe. It&rsquo;s one of those things that should be perfect alternative that users can find out. I think <a href="http://twitter.com/atebits">Loren Brichter</a> actually explained this very well in this <a href="http://unraveled.com/archives/2009/11/tweetie-interview-loren-brichter">interview</a> from 2009 about Tweetie 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, I think you can split gestures into two categories. One is of the pull-down-to-refresh kind. These are gestures that are discoverable and explanatory. The other kind of gestures are like tapping-the-status-bar-to-scroll-to-the-top, or swipe-to-delete (or swipe-to-reply in Tweetie). These gestures you won’t discover on your own except by accident. These are not discoverable, and they are not explanatory.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This second class of gestures can exist (in my opinion) because they are not the only way to accomplish a goal. In the case of tapping the status bar, users already know how to scroll to the top manually. It’s slower, but it’s possible. In the case of swipe to delete, users already know they can tap on a message and then tap the trash button. So knowing the gesture isn’t necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So when you’re inventing new gestures, it’s important to think about whether the gesture is required to use the app. If it’s the only way to accomplish a goal, you better be sure it’s discoverable and explanatory without needing to read a manual. If it’s the other kind of gesture, go nuts!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would class tapping the header left/right text as the second type; you would probably only discover it by accident, but it would be a perfectly acceptable way to navigate. What I don&rsquo;t like at the moment is the big popup that appears telling you to scroll instead; it&rsquo;s an iOS app, we probably would swipe automatically anyway (plus I have a recollection that it gave you a message at on the first launch that you should swipe anyway).</p>
<p>I can see no reason to use the web app over this native one, it&rsquo;s a good start.</p>

<p>I did enjoy my trip on Malta’s buses; sure the one I went on didn’t have a door and it was loud, so I can very much understand the need for the upgrade, but it was a good experience. Hopefully they can keep a few running, or at least give the new ones the same colour scheme.</p>

Just like his first book in the series, &lsquo;The Name of the Wind&rsquo;, it is one of the finest books I have read, if not the best. They are both fantastic, exceptionally well written and very difficult to stop reading.</p>
<p>Thank you Patrick for creating such a good story, I look forward to the next book.</p>

			 <p>‘The Suburbs’ really is a fantastic album. It flows well and is very coherent. Lovely.</p>
<p>‘Funeral’ is also a great album but I do I prefer ‘The Suburbs’ right now.</p>
